 # CAFE MRP!!! 
 
 ###  Due to the COVID - 19 Pandemic many businesses were impacted. There was a need to take safety measures and create a suitable environment for every place. I took the initiative to design a website for restaurants in India to facilitate a contact-free dining experience at a Diner. Cafe MRP was my client and we worked many nights to get it up and running. The code was written in JavaScript, Jquery, PHP HTML, and CSS. The website is hosted on AWS. 
 
###  This was an amazing experience for us. I gained a lot of new skills while doing this and it took a lot of brainstorming to get to my final product. After we finished writing the code we tried to make my interface more beautiful and simple. 

### Below is the link to my website. This is just a replica of my system and the backend here is not optimized. Just select any table number and proceed. The website is optimized for phone usage and you might feel there are some visual glitches if you try to access it using a PC
